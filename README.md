# CollegeManagementSystem
I made this project for my ITE-1002 course at VIT. This repository demonstrates a college management system and handles various interactions between teachers and students.

<h3>To execute</h3>

<p>1) Clone the repository.</p>
<p>2) Open up a terminal and cd into it.</p>
<p>3) Set up the database in mysql workbench using your user name and password.</p>
<p>4) Finally run <b>python manage.py<b>.</p>
