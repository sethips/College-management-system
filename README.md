# CollegeManagementSystem
I made this project for my ITE-1002 course at VIT. This repository demonstrates a college management system and handles various interactions between teachers and students.

<h3>To execute</h3>
<p>
  Clone the repository.<br>
  Open up a terminal and cd into it.
  Set up the database in mysql workbench using your user name and password.
  Finally run python manage.py.
